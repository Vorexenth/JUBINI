              <p>My name is Jered Melvin Perlado, and I am a passionate researcher in the field of website development. I am interested in studying how websites are designed, developed, and improved to provide better user experience and functionality. Through careful research, I analyze design trends, usability, performance, and technology to understand what makes a website effective and user-friendly.</p>
              <p>As a researcher, I aim to create innovative and responsive websites that meet users’ needs while continuously improving my knowledge and skills in web development.</p>

              <p>I’m a creative person who loves expressing myself through music, art, and fashion. I enjoy writing songs because it helps me turn my emotions, thoughts, and experiences into meaningful lyrics. Singing allows me to bring those songs to life and connect with people through sound and feeling.</p>
              <p>I also love drawing, using it as a way to visualize my imagination and relax while creating something unique. Thrifting is another passion of mine — I enjoy finding one-of-a-kind pieces and styling them in my own way, making fashion a form of self-expression. Overall, I’m someone who loves creativity, self-growth, and turning ideas into art.</p>

              <p>Hello! My name is Alyssa Ryzabela Compao. Through this project, I learned how web design combines creativity and technical skills to create functional and visually appealing websites. I gained a better understanding of layout, color selection, typography, and user experience.</p>
              <p>One of the most interesting parts for me was designing the layout and seeing how small details can improve the overall look of a website. I faced challenges with alignment and responsiveness, but I overcame them through practice and problem-solving. I’m especially proud of creating a clean, organized design that reflects both creativity and professionalism.</p>
